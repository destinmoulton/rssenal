### RSSenal

RSSenal is a simple personal RSS feed reader. The server is a node/express api using a mongo database and the client is a React redux app. The client is built using the Semantic UI React framework so it looks decent.

You can organize your subscriptions into groups (categories). Navigate your feeds using up/down arrows or j/k for the vim oriented. Disable HTML tags if you want a pure text experience.

### Motivation

I wanted a simple hosted RSS feed reader. I used to LOVE Google Reader. I like feedly, but I don't like all the unnecessary features that interfere with my reading experience.

### What RSSenal is __Not__

RSSenal was __not__ built with multiple users in mind. There is a login, but the login information is statically configured via a configuration file.

There are __no__ options to share a post on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social platforms. Copying a link is easy enough.
