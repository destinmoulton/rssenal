My throat hurt so much that it actually woke me up. Surely this was a reasonable excuse to get out of the talk I was supposed to give in a couple days. I sent a text to the organizers saying that I wasn't feeling well and would probably skip the trip to Kazakhstan if I didn't feel better the next day, when I was supposed to leave.</p>\n<p>Four months earlier I had felt differently about the trip. My friend Ben Yu got a random email inviting him to speak at a conference called </p>\n\n<p>By the end of the trip I felt like a real idiot for almost bailing on it. Ben and I travel together from time to time, and both of us agreed that it was one of the best trips we'd ever been on. Kazakhstan is an amazing country with tons to offer, and the people were really uniquely friendly. Everyone from our hosts to their family to their friends was so welcoming of us and made us feel like we were part of their families. I was only there for five days and I feel like I left with lifelong friends and an extended Kazakh family. I suspect I'll return just about every year from now on, and will also use the opportunity to check out some of the other countries in the area. All of a sudden they all seem much more interesting.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for a new place to check out, check out Kazakhstan. I would say that it's underrated, except that I don't think anyone actually rates it because they have so little information on it. A HUGE thank you to Alina, Aigulya, Andre, Alex (why does everyone's name begin with A?), and the rest of the amazing people I met in Kazakhstan. I can't wait to come back.</p>\n\n            <p>\n            &gt;&gt; <a href=\"http://tynan.com/kazakhstan?action=reply\">Comment on this Post</a>\n            &middot; <a href=\"http://tynan.com/kazakhstan?action=upvote\">Like this Post</a>\n            </p>\n          <img src='http://sett.com/p.php?uid=1388157'/>\n          <img src=\"http://sett.com/real_time_stats.php?uid=1388157\"/>",

They aren't actually trying to bore you, they just don't know any better. Which begs the question&mdash;are you ever that person?</p>\n<p>In reality I'm sure we all bore someone sometimes, but we can work on reducing or eliminating that to make sure that it happens as infrequently as possible.</p>\n<p>First, think about what benefit the information you're about to share has to the listener. Will they be entertained? Will they learn something useful? Are they a good friend who will want to share your joy or help you with your problem? If there's no benefit, don't share the information. Save it for someone else.</p>\n<p>A prime example for me is politics. During the election everyone wanted to talk about politics, which was never an enjoyable experience for me. I was forced into tons of conversations, very few of which were positive experiences.</p>\n<p>Now, sometimes you'll get it wrong and bring up a topic that the other person isn't interested in. That's an honest mistake that could happen to anyone. Here's where it takes awareness. Don't think of conversation entirely as the skill of relating information. It's equally important to be able to read the other person and gauge their interest level. </p>\n<p>If you're getting a lot of \"uh-huh\" and \"oh, nice\", the person probably isn't interested. Even if your only goal is to talk as much as possible (which it shouldn't be), you're better off cutting these lines of conversation. They will put the other person on guard and cause them to avoid conversation with you.</p>\n<p>If you're not sure, one great way to gauge interest is to intentionally become distracted and cut off the story or conversation. If I'm telling you a story about my daring escape from a group of Antarctic pirate cannibals, there's no way you're going to let me leave without finishing the story. If it's a boring monologue about my thoughts on tax reform, you might take the opportunity I give you to stop the conversation.</p>\n<p>Doing this is very easy. Just interject something into your own story like, \"wait, have I even seen that shirt before?\" \"is your food any good?\" \"need more water?\", or just get up to go to the bathroom. Don't say, \"Hey, is this story boring?\" because that will trigger an obligatory, \"oh, no, not at all\".</p>\n<p>Similarly, keep stories short. Turning a good story into a bad one simply by droning on is a disaster. Abridging a story too much and being asked follow-up questions is a best possible scenario.</p>\n<p>I've written blog posts (and part of a book) about storytelling, so you can get more into this by working on those skills. Basic story telling is a very important skill that pays off huge in life.</p>\n<p>But for now, make sure you are starting conversations for a reason and give the other person an opportunity to switch the topic if they want to.</p>\n<p>###</p>\n<p>Photo is from a lake in Kazakhstan. I came here randomly and am being shown around by some friends of friends. I'm really surprised at how cool Kazakhstan is, especially the nature.</p>\n\n            <p>\n            &gt;&gt; <a href=\"http://tynan.com/boring?action=reply\">Comment on this Post</a>\n            &middot; <a href=\"http://tynan.com/boring?action=upvote\">Like this Post</a>\n            </p>\n          <img src='http://sett.com/p.php?uid=1387203'/>\n          <img src=\"http://sett.com/real_time_stats.php?uid=1387203\"/>",
