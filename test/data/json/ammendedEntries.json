Once there's enough stability more conventional approaches can be used. Architect for discovery before architecting for delivery. Starting with delivery misses the discovery phases which misses opportunities as well as threats. Fractal engagement is they way to achieve change. People don't make decisions about what other people do. People make decision about what they can do tomorrow within their own sphere of influence. The system as a whole orientates through multiple actions.

In just a flash, the guy who had the first agriculture was almost the same guy who had the first spacecraft in 1957. And soon we are going to have the first AIs that really deserve the name, the first true AIs.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4-vpegxYPg\">Dave Snowden</a>~ A key principle of complex design is shift a system to an adjacent possible. Once there's enough stability more conventional approaches can be used. Architect for discovery before architecting for delivery. Starting with delivery misses the discovery phases which misses opportunities as well as threats. Fractal engagement is they way to achieve change. People don't make decisions about what other people do. People make decision about what they can do tomorrow within their own sphere of influence. The system as a whole orientates through multiple actions. You scale be decomposition and recombination, not through aggregation, and not by imitation.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/macbreak-weekly/episodes/614?autostart=false\">Alex Lindsay</a>: When possibility is greater than circumstance you get action.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edge.org/conversation/andrew_barron-the-connectomic-revolution\">Andrew Barron</a>: These are all this family of traits that at one time were considered to be the thing that separated humans from all other animals, and then was slowly recognized to appear in primates and then large-brained mammals. And then suddenly we&rsquo;re recognizing that something like a honey bee, with less than a million neurons, is able to do all of these things.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=3LVeEjsn8Ts\">John Hennessy &amp; David Patterson</a>~ We're entering a new golden age [in processors]. The end of Dennard Scaling and Moore's Law means architecture is where we have to innovate to improve performance, cost, and energy. Rasing the level of abstraction using Domain Specific Languages makes it easier for programmers and architects to innovate. Domain Specific Architectures are getting 20x and 40x improvements, not just 5-10%.</li>\r\n<LI> Hungry for more?
